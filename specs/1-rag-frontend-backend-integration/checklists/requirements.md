# Specification Quality Checklist: RAG Chatbot Frontend-Backend Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-18
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Technology constraints were part of user requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details beyond original constraints)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (beyond original constraints)

## Notes

- All clarifications have been resolved and the specification is ready for planning
- Technology-specific constraints (Docusaurus, FastAPI, HTTP/REST) were part of original user requirements and are acceptable for this integration project
- Specification successfully meets all quality criteria and is ready for the planning phase
