### Independent Test Criteria:
- Chapter draft (chapter_x_content.md) is complete and covers all core topics.
- All research questions are addressed and cited.
- Code examples are fully implemented, tested, and documented.
- Simulation scenarios are developed, run, and results analyzed.
- Diagrams are created, clear, and integrated.
- Chapter passes self-review against the review checklist.
